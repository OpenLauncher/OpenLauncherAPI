The Licence does not apply for 3rd party programs. Look at their licenses!

## Things that need doing

Create a web frontend to create new packs and edit them(PHP)

Create a backend to hold the mod packs and make them(Might be done in java or python)

Create an API so programs can the mod packs(PHP?)

Create a Java lib to use that api, this will be used in the launcher(java)
